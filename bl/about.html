            <h2>About gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The Borderlands games are first-person loot shooters, set in an open world, with some role-playing game (RPG) elements
                (Tales from the Borderlands, however, is an episodic adventure game). The concept came from Randy Pitchford's idea to
                combine the mechanics of first-person shooters like Doom with role-playing games with randomized loot such as Diablo.
                After developing the mechanics of this shooter-RPG hybrid, Gearbox established the idea of players seeking Vaults on the
                planet Pandora, comparing the discovery of new loot to opening a Pandora's box.
            </p>

            <p>   
                Players select one of the available characters, representing Vault Hunters that have traveled to the planet Pandora to
                try to seek its fabled Vault. Each Vault Hunter has a different skill tree and one or more unique abilities. Players
                then work on completing quests and exploring Pandora while dealing with the violent Pandora wildlife, crazed scavengers
                that have been stranded on the planet, and various military groups that attempt to stop them. Completing quests and
                defeating foes earns in-game money and experience, which is used for expanding the player's skill tree. If the player
                loses their health or falls into bottomless chasms, they respawn at the most recent checkpoint and lose some of their
                money. The games are divided into several maps, and once players have reached a waypoint station on the map, they can
                teleport to any other previously visited map. Otherwise, players must reach certain points on the edges of the map to
                move into a different area. Some maps allow the player to spawn an armed vehicle to help traverse large maps or to deal
                with more powerful enemies.
            </p> 

            <p>
                A core feature of Borderlands is the loot system, which generates a variety of guns (such as pistols, shotguns, assault
                rifles, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers), shield generators, grenade modifications, and class modifications. This
                equipment is randomly dropped by foes, found in containers around Pandora, or obtained as rewards for completing quests.
                The statistics of the equipment, such as the amount of damage and accuracy for a gun and special elemental attacks, are
                procedurally generated, and use a loot color-coding system similar to games like World of Warcraft to indicate rarity,
                ranging from white (most common), to purple and orange (most rare and powerful). The first Borderlands is credited by
                the Guinness Book of World Records to have over 17 million different possible guns that could be generated, while the
                latter games expand further on this. Other facets of the game use a similar procedural system: foes may have unique
                attributes and more powerful variants, such as creatures that can spit corrosive acid or flame, or scavengers with
                higher amounts of health and armor. Weapons and other equipment can be sold and bought at various vending machines
                scattered about the maps; nearly all vending machines include a rare piece of loot that is only available for a limited
                amount of in-game time, after which the machine's inventory is rotated for a new set of equipment. Borderlands 2, 3, and
                The Pre-Sequel! include the use of "SHIFT codes", which the player can obtain through social media or other promotions,
                and give players "golden keys" that can be used once to obtain an item of exceptional quality appropriate for the
                player's level; this feature was also added to the remaster of Borderlands.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the player levels, the loot drops will become more powerful; at the same time, the enemies that the player faces on
                the map will increase in level as well. All three games feature a New Game Plus-type replay mode, where they can start
                with the same character at the same level they completed the game with, and continue to level up the character through
                the replay up to a fixed level, making the game more difficult. All three games support co-operative play for up to four
                people; the difficulty of the enemies as well as the quality of the loot drops scales with the number of players.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Borderlands 2 and in the Pre-Sequel, a "Badass Rank" system was added. By completing certain challenges, such as
                killing a number of enemies with a specific weapon type, the player would be awarded Badass points; for every 100
                points, they can then redeem these for one of several small buffs to the player's attributes such as gun damage or
                shield capacity. Selecting the same buff repeatedly on redemption while using a given character would provide less
                beneficial rewards. However, these Badass buffs are shared by all characters that the player has so that if the player
                starts a new character, they will retain all the existing buffs, and new buffs when the points are redeemed will be more
                beneficial; the "Badass Rank" system has been replaced in Borderlands 3 by the "guardian" system.
            </p>

            <p>
                All the games in the series use a comic book-like rendering approach, frequently mistaken as a cel-shaded technique.
                Instead, the games use fully realized hand-drawn textures and within the game engine, add noticeable outlines to create
                the appearance of a comic book setting.

            <h2>Gearbox History</h2>
            <p>Gearbox was founded by five members of the content team from the defunct developer Rebel Boat Rocker: Randy
                Pitchford, Brian Martel, Stephen Bahl, Landon Montgomery, and Rob Heironimus. Before Rebel Boat Rocker, Pitchford
                and Martel previously worked together at 3D Realms, and Montgomery previously worked at Bethesda Softworks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gearbox started with developing expansions to the game Half-Life. Porting Half-Life to console platforms (each with
                new game content) followed, building the company's experience in console game-making, in addition to enhancing and
                building upon the successful Counter-Strike branch of the Half-Life franchise. Prior to Half-Life 2, Gearbox had
                developed or helped develop every Half-Life expansion game or port, including Opposing Force, Blue Shift,
                Counter-Strike, Condition Zero, Half-Life for the Sony PlayStation 2 (Half-Life Decay), and Half-Life for the Sega
                Dreamcast. Branching out to other publishers, Gearbox pursued additional port work, each game being released with
                additional content, but this time from console to PC. These projects included Gearbox's first non-FPS, Tony Hawk's
                Pro Skater 3, and Halo: Combat Evolved, forging new publisher relationships with Activision and Microsoft Game
                Studios respectively. Additional new development, in the form of a PC game in the James Bond franchise (Nightfire)
                for Electronic Arts, also occurred during the company's initial 5-year period.
            </p>

            <p>
                2007 brought announcements of new projects based on licensed film IPs, including the crime drama Heat and the
                science-fiction classic Alien. In the September 2007 issue of Game Informer, a new game franchise was revealed, the
                sci-fi shooter/vehicle combat game Borderlands, after which Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford mentioned in an online
                interview that development on the Heat game had not yet begun, as the planned development partner for the project
                had gone under. This was followed by an announcement by Sega that Gearbox would be helming a new version of rhythm
                game Samba de Amigo for the Wii, a departure from their signature FPS titles.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2008, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford announced that the company was working on yet another major unannounced title,
                hinting that is was "huge".
            </p>

            <p>
                October 2010 it was revealed that Gearbox Software had assumed the helm of the long awaited Duke Nukem: Forever
                project. Two other unnamed projects are linked on their site at the time of this writing.
