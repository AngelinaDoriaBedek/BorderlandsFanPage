                <h3>Setting</h3>
                <p>
                    The games in Borderlands primarily take place on the planet <b>Pandora</b>. Pandora is believed to be rich with mineral wealth
                    leading several interstellar megacorporations to send colony ships there to capitalize on it, but once they arrive, they
                    find little of value outside of undecipherable alien artifacts from a long-extinct race known as the <b>Eridians</b>, and
                    numerous native lifeforms make it too dangerous to colonize. Many of the corporations abandon the planet, leaving behind
                    their workforce, former prisoners coerced into employment, who take over much of the planet as <i>bandits</i> and <i>raiders</i>.
                    However, a study of the alien artifacts leads to the discovery of <b>mythical Eridian Vaults</b> filled with untold treasure
                    and wealth, which are guarded by extremely powerful and ancient monsters. Corporations and military forces return to the
                    planet, along with a number of <i><b>Vault Hunters</b></i> who seek to find the Vaults themselves. The settings are expanded to
                    include <b>the moon of Pandora</b> in <ins>Borderlands: The Pre-sequel</ins>, and other planets in <ins>Borderlands 3</ins> where further Eridian
                    Vaults have been found.

                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>
                    Shortly after the <b>Dahl</b> corporation leaves the planet Pandora at the start of Borderlands, <i><b>four Vault Hunters</b></i> arrive to
                    seek out the Vault - <b>Roland, Lilith, Mordecai, and Brick</b>. They are guided by a mysterious entity, <i><b>the Guardian Angel</b></i>,
                    that lives within the planet's communication <i>EchoNet system</i>, to collect pieces of the <i>Vault Key</i>, but warned that the
                    Vault can only be accessed <ins>every 200 years</ins>, and that time is soon approaching, urging them onward. They eventually
                    complete the Key, but immediately come into conflict with the <b>Atlas corporation</b> coming back to claim Pandora and the
                    Vault. The Vault Hunters fight Atlas back and locate the Vault, but upon opening, it releases a giant monster, named <i><b>the
                    "Destroyer"</b></i>. They fight off the monster and push it back into the Vault, which then closes, leaving Pandora safe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <i>the Pre-Sequel</i>, <b>Jack</b>, a low-level programmer for <b>Hyperion</b>, discovers another Vault on <ins>Pandora's moon, Elpis</ins>, and
                    hires six more Vault Hunters - <b>Wilhelm, Athena, Claptrap, Nisha, Timothy, and Aurelia</b> - to seek it in the wake of the
                    First Vault's closure. With the Vault Hunters' help, Jack is able to seize control of <b>Helios, the Hyperion space station</b>
                    in orbit between Pandora and Elpis, and uses its resources to secure the Vault with the help of the Hunters. Inside,
                    there is only a strange artifact in the shape of the Vault symbol, but when Jack touches it, he experiences visions of
                    the imminent release of <i>the "Warrior"</i>. Jack starts to go mad with power, and Lilith punches the artifact into his face,
                    disfiguring him forever. Jack assumes his mask, <i><b>becoming Handsome Jack</b></i>, and takes over Hyperion as he swears vengeance
                    on the Vault Hunters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <i>Borderlands 2</i>, six new Hunters have arrived to find a new Vault that has been discovered on Pandora, but Handsome
                    Jack uses his vast array of Hyperion resources to try to stop them. The new Hunters - <b>Axton, Maya, Salvador, Zer0,
                    Gaige, and Krieg</b> - are aided by <b>Roland</b> and his former Vault Hunters, now leading a resistance known as the <b>Crimson
                    Raiders</b>, secured in their base <b>Sanctuary</b>, and further <i>guided by the Guardian Angel, who is revealed to be Jack's Siren
                    daughter, dying from excessive usage of her powers</i>. Jack had used Angel to trick the former Vault Hunters into opening
                    the Vault on Pandora to gain access to <i>Eridium, a special alien mineral with untold properties</i>. After The Vault Hunters
                    kill Angel in an act of mercy and to disrupt Jack's plan, Jack appears in Angel's chamber and proceeds to kill Roland.
                    Lilith teleports The Vault Hunters to safety before being captured by Jack and used to finish charging the Vault Key.
                    While they find the Vault, Jack arrives and joins them as they open it, and he summons forth the gigantic Warrior, which
                    he wants to use to control Pandora and beyond. The Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior and leave Jack to his death before
                    discovering that <i>the Vault Key contains a map leading to Vaults across the galaxy</i>, with Lilith stating <i><b>"there's no rest
                    for the wicked"</b></i>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sometime after these events, in <ins>Tales of the Borderlands</ins>, the absence of Jack's control leaves a power void on both
                    Pandora and Hyperion. <b>A Hyperion lackey, Rhys</b>, and <b>a con artist Fiona</b> get caught up in events over the sale of a fake
                    Vault Key to Rhys' superior for ten million dollars. They discover that there is another vault, the <i><b>Vault of the
                    Traveler</b></i>, controlled by an Atlas prototype robot named <i>Gortys</i>. As they collect the scattered parts of Gortys, Rhys
                    inadvertently downloads an AI copy of Handsome Jack's personality into his cybernetic mind. Rhys and Fiona's group makes
                    to Helios in a makeshift spacecraft, and Scooter sacrifices himself to assure they get there. Once back on Helios, Jack
                    takes over the entire station. Rhys and Fiona stop Jack and cause the station to crash into Pandora, wiping out Jack's
                    personality for good. After going their separate ways for a while, They reunite to help defeat the Traveler, another
                    giant Vault monster, freeing Gortys and leaving the Vault to be explored.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <ins>Borderlands 3</ins> follows 7 years after the events of Borderlands 2 and Tales. After being forced to destroy Sanctuary to
                    protect Pandora from a doomsday plot by former Dahl commander, <b>Colonel Hector, Lilith and the Crimson Raiders</b> recover
                    the Vault Key/Map to discover the many Vaults that exist across the galaxy, and travel among planets via their new
                    spacecraft <b>Sanctuary III</b>. However, <b>the Calypso Twins, Tyreen and Troy</b>, have claimed themselves the rightful owners of
                    the Vaults, creating a cult of personality, <i>the Children of the Vault</i>, from the remnant bandit factions of Pandora to
                    secure these Vaults themselves, and making a strategic partnership with megacorporation Maliwan for military support.
                    Lilith recruits new Vault Hunters - <b>Zane, Amara, FL4K, and Moze</b> - to help secure these Vaults before Tyreen and Troy
                    can. They learn that the pair are Sirens themselves, seeking to absorb the power of the Vault monsters for their own to
                    open the <b>"Great Vault"</b>, <ins>revealed to be the planet Pandora itself</ins>, unaware that it still contains the "Destroyer", which
                    is further explained to be a being intent on destroying the universe. With the help of former and new allies, the
                    Crimson Raiders managed to stop the Calypso Twins and kill the Destroyer but at the cost of Maya and Lilith's lives,
                    although the latter's fate is ambiguous.

                        Krieg, the most badass and heroic psycho in the galaxy. By utilizing neural digimatrix technology invented by the
                        brilliant Patricia Tannis, you can experience Krieg's inner thoughts firsthand, from the utterly chaotic to the
                        surprisingly serene. Within this cobbled-together consciousness, you'll find mindscapes reflecting Krieg's dual
                        personalities, where free association takes physical form. Don't let the mountains of viscera, eyeballs, and jagged
                        bones blind you—there's more to Krieg than visions of wanton violence.
